      <p>When you order you will be asked to provide a contact name and number at the delivery location. It is your responsibility to make sure someone will be at the delivery location during the delivery time. We do our best to leave the delivery with someone or indoors.

      <h4>- How do I store my cupcakes?</h4>
      <p>If you are planning on eating them within a day you can store them at room temperature. If you are not going to eat them right away you can freeze them. To thaw them, take them out of the freezer and cover them lightly with plastic wrap while they thaw. This will minimize condensation forming on the cupcakes. They should be ready to eat in about an hour. You should not refrigerate your cupcakes overnight because they will dry out.</p>
